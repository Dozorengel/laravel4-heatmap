## Laravel 4 - Heatmap

This package for Laravel 4 adds some basic click logging to your website by providing a simple API. For now, it just logs the following stuff about a click:

* **URL of origin**
* **Width of viewport:** used for filtering clicks by viewport. This way you can analyze the clicks for different viewports.

When you have collected some clicks for a web page, you can view a heatmap of that page to see where your users have been clicking.

## TODO
* write usage instructions

## Credits to
* **Patrick Wied** for his awesome [Heatmap.js](https://github.com/pa7/heatmap.js) library.
